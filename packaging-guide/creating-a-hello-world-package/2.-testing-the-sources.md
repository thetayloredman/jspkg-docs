# 2. Testing The Sources

Let's do a simple test. Just extract the tarball:

```bash
$ tar -xf hello-world_1.0.orig.tar.gz
$ cd hello-world_1.0
$ ./build.sh
$ ./main
Hello, World!
```

It works!

Delete the test files:

```bash
cd ..
rm -rf hello-world_1.0
```

It worked! Move on to the next part \(but get a snack first\)
